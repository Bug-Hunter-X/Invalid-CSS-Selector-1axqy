The following CSS code uses an invalid selector that causes unexpected behavior or errors in the browser's rendering engine.
```css
.invalid-selector { /* some styles */ }
```
This selector is invalid, because it is missing the element to select.
In this case, the correct selector should select an actual element in the HTML. For example:
```css
div.invalid-selector { /* some styles */ }
```
This selector correctly selects all the div elements with the class name "invalid-selector".
